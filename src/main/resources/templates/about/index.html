					Murray M. White Inc. was founded over 80 years ago in High Point, North Carolina. The vision of a family owned and operated, Independent Insurance Agency, that prides itself in creating a true partnership protecting what’s most important to you, began with Murray M. White, Sr. in July of 1937.
				</p>
				<p>
					The doors first opened at 118 E. Commerce Street after an agreement to purchase both the Furniture City Insurance Agency and Manufactures Insurance Agency. Since then, the agency has experienced much growth in the city of High Point and while staying true to its vision. Today you can find the offices in the heart of High Point, just past the intersection of N. Main Street and Eastchester Drive.
				</p>
				<p>
					Murray White, Sr. had a soft retirement in 1969, due to some health issues and later pass on November 26, 1971.  He left the business to his son, Murray White, Jr. Since then, the business has again been passed on to Murray White, III and you can find his son, Murray White, IV assisting with carrying on the initial vision set forth by the patriarch of the family.
				</p>
				<p>
					A lot has happened since Murray White, Sr opened the doors in 1937. In 1973, they opened an affiliate business, Murray White Associates, which has a specialty in life and health insurance. In 2013, a decision was made to slightly adjust the original name, Murray M. White, Inc. to draw more attention to the Insurance business they are in. Hence was born, Murray M. White Insurance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Amidst all the change, in both the city of High Point and the insurance industry, Murray M. White Insurance has remained a prominent name in town. Living out the original vision the company was founded on, Murray M. White Insurance is proud to be a family owned and operated Insurance Company in High Point, NC, with a focus on creating a true partnership in protecting what’s most important to you!
